Class Notes-4
Locators
Selenium read webpage as a source code,
selenium knows how to read html code.

Selenium uses locators to locate different webelements

driver--> our page, browser

findElement()--> method used to find element on the webpage

locators--> methods, means, intruments of finding elements on the page

Find Element menthod takes By object as an argument.

By is a name of class for locators.

8 different types of locators
id
name
classname
tagname
linktext
partiallinktext
xpath
css
==================================
How to identify Elements ?
1.Navigate to applicaiton ( go to website )
2.Open the source code, inspect element, (right click, inspect)
3.Find the unique property for the element (8 locators)
======================
1.Right click tests
2.Create - new package ->com.cybertek.tests.day4_basic_locators
Create class under it -> IdLocatorTest
=======================
ID--> first locator, if there is id we will choose it most of the time, because it is unique.

*** id is unique but it might be dynamic so make sure it is not changing before use it.

if findElement() does two things
if element found with given locator--> returns the WebElement
if element NOT found with given locator-->NoSuchElementException
=====================
Name: if there is no id,we use name locator
name locator might be duplicate(radioButtons) be careful.
name is not dynamic %99.9 of the time.
============
TagName:we can use html tag to locate element
<input type="text" name="full_name">
input --> tag of the element
rest is attribute and value

Selenium reads the source code from top to bottom.
if your locators matched with one webelement, selenium stops there.

***if you want to search something in the inspect page, click ctrl/cmd + F

if there is no id or name, we can use tagname based on two conditions
1.tag should be used only one time OR
2.you want to point first matching tag web element

we cannot use index when we use tagname.If there are multiple usage of same tag, we cannot point second one.

=================
className: another attribute for location elements
We will use it later to locate multiple elements in one shot.

when we shouln't use classname locator ?
if there is a space in the class attribute value, we CANNOT use it.
=====================
linktext and partiallinktext
linktext -->using full text of link to locate link webelement on the webpage
partiallinktext--> using part of the linktext to locate link webelement
